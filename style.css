Description: Gridiculous is a lightweight HTML5 responsive theme based on the grid layout boilerplate of the same name. Use the new Theme Options customizer to add your own header image, custom background, page layout, site width, link color and more. Distinguish each post with one of the eight supported post formats: Video, Image, Aside, Status, Audio, Quote, Link and Gallery. Install JetPack to display each of your galleries through a tiled view and jQuery carousel. Uses Normalize.css for cross browser compatibility and two Google Fonts for improved typeface readability. Compatible with bbPress &amp; BuddyPress. Works perfectly in desktop browsers, tablets and handheld devices. For a live demo go to http://demos.bavotasan.com/gridiculous/.
